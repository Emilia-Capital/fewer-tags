# Less Tags
One of the most common SEO problems on WordPress sites is that people add too many tags to posts. The WordPress interface makes it incredibly easy to do so, and with every tag you add, you add another URL to your site for search engines to crawl and index. This plugin minimizes that effect by setting a minimum number of posts needed for a tag to be “live” on your site.

Tags that have less than the configured number of posts:
 * don't work on your site, and are redirected to your homepage.
 * no longer show up in tag listings.
 * are no longer linked in WordPress core's or Yoast SEO generated XML sitemaps.

This positively affects your site's SEO and also leads to less crawling, as you have less useless tag pages.
