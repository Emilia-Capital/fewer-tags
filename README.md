# Minimum Tag Requirements
Simple plugin that 301 redirects tag pages to the home page if they contain fewer than a specified number of posts (by default 10). Change setting under Settings > Reading after activation.

Tags that have less than the configured number of posts also no longer show up in tag listings.
